# MovieMuse

Have you ever found yourself scrolling endlessly trying to find the right movie? Settling on the first movie you see after searching for the last 30mins? *cough* You could’ve watched an episode of The Office while deciding. With Movie Muse you’ll be able to instantly search our movies database and filter the results based on categories, popularity and trending. Using our secret algorithm, you search for a movie through a category and you can reroll up to 5 times. What happens after 5? Time to pick your movie, sit back, play and enjoy cinematic brilliance. Movie choices, made simple. <br />
